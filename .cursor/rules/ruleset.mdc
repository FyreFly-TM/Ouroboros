Loop round‑robin through every matched file.

For each file:

Fill in any TODO, FIXME, or blatant placeholder blocks.

Keep the existing code style, comments, and APIs intact.

Run quick lint adjustments (rename unused vars, remove dead imports).

Skip heavyweight refactors—leave those for a dedicated pass.

After finishing all files, provide a concise summary of what changed.

## Token‑Limit Protocol

When the reply is about to overflow the model’s output budget, respond with
exactly CONTINUE on its own line so the user/agent can chain calls.

Resume with the next file immediately in the follow‑up response.

## Commit Strategy (Background‑Agent mode)

Commit after each file modification to avoid massive diffs.

Format commit message as:

chore(sweep): <filename> – <one‑line tweak>


If no iterative-sweep/<YYYY-MM-DD> branch exists, create it and push.
