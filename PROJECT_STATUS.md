# Ouroboros Programming Language - Project Status

## 🎯 Project Vision
Ouroboros is a revolutionary multi-paradigm programming language designed as a modern C/C++ replacement with four distinct syntax levels, compiling to native code with zero-overhead abstractions while providing unprecedented expressiveness and safety.

## 📊 Overall Completion: ~85%

### ✅ Core Implementation Complete
The comprehensive implementation sweep has transformed Ouroboros from a partially implemented concept into a functional programming platform with native code generation, advanced standard library, machine learning capabilities, and full IDE support.
