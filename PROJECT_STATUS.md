# Ouroboros Programming Language - Project Status

## Current Phase: Comprehensive Implementation Sweep Complete ✓

### Completed Phases:

#### Phase 1: Testing & Build Infrastructure ✓
- Comprehensive test framework with assertions and test discovery
- CMake build system with platform detection
- Support for JIT, GPU, tests, docs, tools, LSP options
- Test runner with unit and integration test support

#### Phase 2: Language Core Features ✓
- Module system with import/export mechanisms
- Async/await runtime with custom task scheduler
- Hygiene-aware macro system
- Contract programming (requires, ensures, invariants)
- Interactive REPL with multi-line support and tab completion

#### Phase 3: Native Code Generation ✓
- LLVM backend integration with IR generation
- Optimization passes (O0-O3, size optimization)
- Target triple configuration
- Native executable generation

#### Phase 4: Standard Library Enhancement ✓
- Comprehensive collections (List, Dictionary, Queue, Stack)
- Date/Time operations with timezone support
- Advanced file I/O with async operations
- Linear algebra (Vector, Matrix, Quaternion, Transform)
- Math symbols and operations

#### Phase 5: Database & Persistence ✓
- Database abstraction layer with provider pattern
- Placeholder providers for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- Fluent query builder API
- Transaction support
- Schema operations

#### Phase 6: Machine Learning DSL ✓
- Tensor operations with broadcasting support
- Neural network layers (Dense, ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax)
- Optimizers (SGD with momentum, Adam)
- Loss functions (MSE, CrossEntropy)
- High-level model builder API

#### Phase 7: Documentation Infrastructure ✓
- Documentation generator with HTML/Markdown/JSON output
- AST-based documentation extraction
- Syntax highlighting support
- Cross-referencing and search

#### Phase 8: IDE Integration ✓
- Syntax highlighter with TextMate scope support
- Code completion provider with context awareness
- Real-time diagnostic provider with quick fixes
- LSP foundation for VS Code integration

### Outstanding TODOs:

1. **Package Manager (OPM)**
   - Package registry integration
   - Dependency resolution
   - Version management
   - Package publishing

2. **Platform Features**
   - GPU kernel compilation
   - Quantum computing backend
   - WebAssembly target
   - Mobile platform support

3. **Advanced Language Features**
   - Pattern matching improvements
   - Algebraic effects
   - Dependent types
   - Compile-time evaluation

4. **Runtime Enhancements**
   - JIT optimization
   - Advanced garbage collection
   - Memory pooling
   - Profile-guided optimization

### Next Steps:
1. Integration testing of all components
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Documentation website deployment
4. Community feedback incorporation
5. Release preparation

### Known Issues:
- Database providers require NuGet packages
- Some AST visitors have placeholder implementations
- Type inference needs more sophisticated analysis
- REPL needs better error recovery

### Build Instructions:
```bash
# CMake build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_TOOLS=ON
cmake --build .

# .NET build
dotnet build
dotnet test
```
