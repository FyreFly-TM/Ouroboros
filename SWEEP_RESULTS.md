5. **Documentation** - Generate API docs and usage examples 

## Second Implementation Pass Results

### Updated Components

#### BytecodeOptimizer.cs

#### Development Tools Status
**Debugger (debugger.cs)**:

### Conclusion

The OUROBOROS language has a solid foundation with innovative features like:
- Multi-level syntax (natural language to assembly)
- Domain-specific operator overloading
- First-class GPU support
- Built-in ML capabilities
- Zero-overhead abstractions

However, it needs significant work to be production-ready:
1. Complete VM implementation
2. Implement missing language features
3. Build proper tooling ecosystem
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Write documentation

The architecture shows promise but needs refinement to resolve circular dependencies and namespace conflicts.
