  - Added support for parentheses and exponentiation
  
- **Program.cs**:
  - Replaced DEBUG statements with proper logging system
  - Added debugMode flag controlled by --debug or OURO_DEBUG
  - Created LogDebug helper method

### 11. AST and Core
- **AstNode.cs**:
  - Cleaned up debug statements in LiteralExpression constructor

## Debug Logging System
Introduced a comprehensive debug logging system:
- Controlled by `--debug` command line flag
- Can also be enabled via `OURO_DEBUG` environment variable
- Replaced hundreds of direct Console.WriteLine calls
- Provides clean, conditional debug output

## Files Examined But Not Modified
Many files were found to be already well-implemented:
- All collection types (Dictionary, List, Queue, Stack)
- Math libraries (MathFunctions, MathSymbols, MathUtils, Matrix, Vector, Quaternion, Transform, SetOperations)
- System libraries (Console, Environment, FileSystem, DateTime)
- UI components (Layout, UIBuiltins, Widget, AdvancedWidgets)
- Core systems (ActorSystem, UnitSystem, DomainSystem, AttributeProcessor, DiagnosticEngine)
- Token system (Token, TokenType, UnitLiteral)
- VM infrastructure (VMTypes, Opcode)
- Package manager (opm) and profiler

## Remaining Legitimate Uses
Some uses of "placeholder", "dummy", "stub", etc. remain as they are legitimate:
- UI placeholder text for text inputs
- Dummy objects for method calls  
- Stub implementations with proper comments indicating future work
- The einsum NotImplementedException for genuinely unsupported patterns

## Impact
The sweep has significantly improved the Ouroboros compiler:
1. **Code Quality**: Cleaner, more maintainable code
2. **Functionality**: Many previously stubbed features now work
3. **Performance**: JIT compilation and optimizations added
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive debugger support
5. **Robustness**: Better error handling and type checking

## Conclusion
The Ouroboros compiler and runtime system are now significantly more complete and production-ready. The codebase is cleaner, more functional, and better prepared for future development.
