# Ouroboros Project Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring work done on the Ouroboros programming language implementation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Namespace and Type Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple `TypeNode` classes defined in different namespaces:
  - `Ouroboros.Core.AST.TypeNode` (in AstNode.cs)
  - `Ouroboros.Core.Compiler.TypeNode` (in CompilerTypes.cs)
  - Placeholder classes in VMTypes.cs

- **Solution**:
  - Added `using Ouroboros.Core.AST` to CompilerTypes.cs
  - Removed duplicate TypeNode and ParameterNode definitions from CompilerTypes.cs
  - Updated FunctionInfo to use `List<Parameter>` instead of `List<ParameterNode>`
  - Removed placeholder TypeNode and ParameterNode classes from VMTypes.cs
  - Updated VMTypes.cs to use `AST.Parameter` instead of `ParameterNode`

### 2. AnalysisPass.cs Issues
- **Problem**: Incorrect type references causing compilation errors
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed SemanticModel to use `Core.AST.Program` instead of ambiguous `Program`
  - Fixed Symbol class to use `Core.AST.TypeNode` for its Type property
  - Removed unnecessary casts when calling GetAllNodes

### 3. TypeChecker.cs Issues
- **Problem**: Missing required properties in TypeRegistry
- **Solution**: Added missing type properties:
  - Float
  - Bool  
  - Char
  - Void
  - Null

### 4. Project File Updates
- **Problem**: Some files were excluded from compilation due to errors
- **Solution**: Re-enabled TypeChecker.cs and VMTypes.cs after fixing their issues

## Remaining Issues

The following directories are still excluded from compilation and may need attention:
- `src/syntaxes/**/*.cs` (except HighLevelParser.cs which is included)
- `src/types/**/*.cs`
- `src/optimization/**/*.cs`

These files may contain additional issues that need to be addressed.

## Architecture Overview

The Ouroboros language implementation consists of:
- **Core Components**: Lexer, Parser, Compiler, Virtual Machine
- **Type System**: Multi-level type system with AST types and compiler types
- **Analysis System**: Various analyzers for mathematical notation, domains, units, etc.
- **Special Features**:
  - GPU programming support (CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan, SPIR-V)
  - Actor system with supervision
  - Domain-specific operator redefinition
  - Unit system for dimensional analysis
  - Assembly integration
  - Mathematical notation support

## Build Status

After the refactoring:
- TypeChecker.cs ✅ Fixed and re-enabled
- VMTypes.cs ✅ Fixed and re-enabled
- CompilerTypes.cs ✅ Fixed namespace issues
- AnalysisPass.cs ✅ Fixed type references

The core compilation should now work correctly with these fixes applied.
